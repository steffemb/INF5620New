PASS on wave project.

Nice code, but not efficient. You should use ghost points to set up the boundaries.
The movies is nice, but wrong, you do not have a perfect reflecting boundaries. 

Maybe it will be nice to not use a start when importing from librabry, so you do not make conflict between modules.


You should have a report.
